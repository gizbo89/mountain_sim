\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Mountain climbing and trekking are popular recreational activities, but they come with inherent risks, such as avalanches and steep terrain. "mountain\_sim" is a software project aimed at optimizing mountaineering trails to enhance safety and improve user experience.

\subsection{Objective}
The primary objective of this project is to develop a software tool capable of optimizing mountaineering trails based on various criteria, including safety considerations, trail steepness, and other user-defined parameters.

\section{Motivation}
This project aims to address the following motivations:
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
    \item Enhancing safety: By avoiding avalanche-prone areas and minimizing risks associated with steep terrain.
    \item Improving user experience: By optimizing trails to provide an enjoyable and less strenuous hiking experience.
    \item Increasing accessibility: By providing hikers with optimized routes that cater to their skill levels and preferences.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}
\subsection{Topology Analysis}
The software will employ advanced mathematical frameworks to analyze the topology of mountainous regions. This analysis will include identifying potential avalanche paths and assessing the steepness of terrain.

\subsection{Data Integration}
The software will integrate Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to accurately represent surface terrain. Additionally, it will utilize weather data and other environmental factors to enhance trail optimization.

\subsection{Graphical Representation}
To aid visualization, the software will provide graphical representations of the surface terrain and risk zones corresponding to defined optimization criteria. These visualizations will assist users in understanding the terrain and making informed decisions.

\section{Structure}
The software consists of several modules to facilitate trail optimization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DEM reader: Module responsible for importing Digital Elevation Models.
    \item Solar angle calculator: Calculates solar radiation for terrain analysis.
    \item Surface Topology descriptors: Analyzes the topology of mountainous regions.
    \item Projection tools: Projects 2D representations onto 3D terrain models.
    \item 3D Plot tool: Generates 3D visualizations of the terrain and risk zones.
    \item Fluid/Structure interaction: Models the interaction between fluids (e.g., snow) and terrain structures.
    \item Fluids simulator: Simulates fluid behavior, including thermal effects.
    \item Weather influence: Incorporates weather data to assess its impact on trail conditions.
    \item Snow/Other materials simulation: Simulates the behavior of snow and other materials on the terrain.
\end{itemize}
